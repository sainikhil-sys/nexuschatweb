## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* pip
* Git

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd SDF

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate environment
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# 5. Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# 6. Start development server
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

> Development mode uses **SQLite** and **InMemoryChannelLayer**, so Redis and PostgreSQL are not required locally.
